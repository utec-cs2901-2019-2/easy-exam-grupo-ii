# User Guide: EasyExam - Group 2

## Introduction
EasyExam is an online platform aiming to help professors to generate problems for the exams that they wish to take their students. EasyExam works on a 3x1 system in which each the user sends 1 problem for every 3 they will recieve, it is in order to encourage the collaboration within the system. When the teacher creates an account on the platform, he gets 3 credits, once he gets 3 problems, he will have to upload 1 problem to be able to visualize three others, this is the 3x1 system. Then, users can download the generated exams in PDF and Latex format.
